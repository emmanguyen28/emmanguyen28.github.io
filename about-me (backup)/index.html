      Hi everyone, it's Ha here, or call me Emma! I'm a Computer Science major at Mount Holyoke College, MA, USA (Math is also a dear to me). I love playing around with ideas. Building them, implementing them, destroying them, then building them from scratch. I am also interested in writing. It actually tore me apart to finish these writings you see here, but now I thought about it, I felt so happy to have produced these! I know, I know, it's a love-hate relationship. Anw, tldr; in this website I'll be updating my CS projects, and a chunk of others like writings, Math projects, or even my photgraphy! Enjoy!!
