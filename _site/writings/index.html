          <p>The bride and groom rushed over to greet the guests. They rushed to the front of the flowers. They smiled at each other. 1, 2, 3. Button clicked. Shutters whirred. Families hurried to pose next to the newly-weds. 1, 2, 3. Guests hastened to save memories. 1, 2, 3. Everyone on the scene dashed to gather in one last photo. 1, 2, 3. Button clicked and camera shutters whirred.</p>

          <p>My family was always on the move. We moved from the countryside to the city, from cities to cities, from the outskirts to the city center. We would move numerous times, to different areas, depending on my parents’ financial abilities and interests – sometimes for a better living environment, sometimes for my education, others for their businesses.</p>

          <ul style="list-style: none;"> - Into the space - </ul>
<p>From afar, I can see its window sheltering under the building’s shadows. A few more steps, heaven lies ahead, even though the room has barely any furniture, or decorations, or ethereal aroma. Its space is so limited 2 people would feel cramped in it. It is mostly empty, with only a small brown wooden piano, a black chair of typical modern design, and 2 frameless mirrors, one short, one long. A window covers almost half the wall, making way for natural sunlight, accompanied by shades of green from the grass right outside. The wall is made of bare, rough, deep antique red bricks evenly placed side by side, occasionally stained with white paint. Some bricks scream of being time’s victims. The borders among the bricks are blurry, yet attracting intense attraction over their colors. The room is enchanting in the varied intensity of redness, the touch of whiteness, the interruption of brownness, and the occasional sojourn of greenness.</p>

          <p>She possesses that dreamy look, like she’s always on her honeymoon. Look at her, and one will discover that, romance is in her lashes, heaven is in her eyes, and her feelings are her world.</p>

          <p><em>Can you describe how you tie your shoes, how you wash your hands, how you wear clothes? These are those things that we take for granted every day. These are bygones of our childhood, of Mother’s attentive voice, or maybe some of us are even born with them. Are those things worth being noticed, though? Maybe no, but when thinking about creativity, maybe they are.<em></em></em></p>

          <p>Lying in low light, this Fungia coral still shines to my attention. It has a dome shape, with a trench in the middle. It is the mushroom under the sea, that distinguishes itself from its in-land peers by eliminating all parts of its body but the cap. It is also superior in its enormity, that would carry an entire basketball. It is as thick as a waffle. The thickness holds thousands of layers of vertically parallel, milky dusty white materials boasting serrated edges. Look at it from the top down, beauty galore: layers of the coral spark associations of soft vintage laces, but uneven laces, hence giving off a charm, that is delicate, yet still wild, unrestricted. Look at it from the bottom up, a whole new perspective of imagination opens up. Currents of sea-spirit liquids stream from a center, down into all directions, creating an ether in which perceptions of the sea and the soil, all mingle.</p>
